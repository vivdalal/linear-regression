# Linear Regression on King County Housing Data set

I am using the King County Housing Data set. It has 21613 rows and has 21 features. There is a mix of quantitative and qualitative feautres.

I have applied different models and covered the following topics:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Association between independent and dependent variables
* Discuss model assumptions
* Compare and evaluate models
* Correlation between independent variables
* Dummy variable creation for binary as well multli-class qualitative variables
* Calculation of model evaluation metrics like : R2, Adjusted R2, p-value, AIC, BIC
* Interaction term
* Regularization
  * Ridge Regression
* Cross Validation
* Step Wise Regression - Forward Regression
* KNN Regression(Just to explore how it performs and how different is it from linear regression)
